# SaaS-Product-Health-Lakehouse
A modern end-to-end data engineering project that unifies product usage, billing, and support data into a single analytics-ready lakehouse.

# The Product
IMS Traverse – Travel & Spend Analytics Platform
IMS Traverse is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics project that simulates a Concur-style travel & expense platform for a consulting company. It ingests travel bookings, expenses, and project time-tracking data into a unified data model using Python/PySpark and SQL, then exposes curated tables and dashboards to answer questions about travel spend, policy compliance, and project profitability.

# Business Problem
A mid-size SaaS company is struggling to understand the health of its product and customers because their data is scattered across different systems:
	•	Product team uses event logs
	•	Support team uses a ticketing tool
	•	Finance uses a separate billing system
	•	Leadership wants clear visibility into product adoption, customer satisfaction, and churn risk
	•	There is no unified, trusted dataset or dashboard

This causes:
	•	contradicting reports in meetings
	•	slow decision-making
	•	inability to identify at-risk customers
	•	no clear visibility into feature success
	•	no structured method to link product issues to business impact

The company needs a modern, reliable data platform that integrates these sources into one analytics-ready model.
